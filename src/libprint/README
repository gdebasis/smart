Directory  /smart/src/libprint
        Source library for printing SMART objects to either
        memory or a file

The source files in this directory fall into one of the 
following types, with the name of the file giving the type:

p_*.c   Low-level print procedures to print 
        individual smart tuples to incore buffer

pi_*.c  Low level print procedures to print interpreted smart 
        tuples (ie, what the smart tuple describes instead 
        of the smart tuple itself) to buffer

po_*.c  Low level print procedures to print a set of 
        interpreted smart objects (ie, what the smart object 
        describes) to a buffer

ph_*.c  Low level hierarchy print procedures to print interpreted 
        individual smart tuples to a buffer.

phl_*.c	Same as ph_*.c but assume that the docids are always
	"crammed part lists" and formats them accordingly.

pobj_*.c  Mid level hierarchy procedures to print entire 
        relational objects to a file.  Calls one or more of 
        low level procedures above.

print.c  Top level hierarchy procedure to call one of pobj_*.c.
